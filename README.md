# Virtual_Assistant
This is a virtual assistant with different tools.

The alt.txt contains some of the things that can be changed in the code to swap out different libraries.
The try.py file is for trying out the different voices offered by the pyt2s library.
The main.py and tools.py files are only required to run the agent.

All collaborations are welcome, there are some bugs that I haven't been able to figure out how to fix yet, if you manage to do that, then do create and submit a pull request.
